//  we can think of parse as an online database store. it is saving objects. we can upload our variables and objects and then download them later on to use on the same device or a different device.
//we can store a variety of things in parse including variables, arrays, dictionaries, files, boolean variables.

//we will also set up some spinners and alerts. we will use an activity indicator for the spinner

//this is a login module that works with parse. it takes the PFUser object and grabs parameters from the user through the interface. when an error occurs on the parse side, we are putting the error message in an alert to prompt the user.
